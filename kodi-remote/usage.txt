KODI-REMOTE

kodi-remote.py  -a <address> -p <port>  -u <username> -P <password>

Address can be that of a remote kodi instance, 'loopback' or '127.0.0.1'.

Return or double click plays a playlist item.

Space plays or pauses an item, or activates a focused player button.

Right and left arrow keys, PageUp and PageDown, skip forward and back.

Tab and Shift+Tab navigate keyboard focus around the kodi-remote window.

Alt+D or click toggles the media details pane between playlist item and
playing item details.

Escape clears the playlist filter.

To filter a playlist by artist and/or composer, use the following syntax
(case insensitive):

<word (beginning or complete)>+<word (beginning or complete)>...
To match alternative spellings:

<word (beginning or complete)>|<word (beginning or complete)>...

For example, janso+tchai|tschai|tsjai|tjaj might find UK/US/French, German,
Dutch and Scandinavian broadcasts that include works by Tchaikovsky
conducted by Mariss Jansons.

There is no need to use a language virtual keyboard - bartok will do for Bart√≥k.
(Latin characters with diacritics will be reduced to their plain equivalents.)

To browse and filter your complete collection of playlists, click the
'Combine' button bottom left.
